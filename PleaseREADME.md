PHASE 1: The DATA
- Before moving into any meaningful stratagies or predictions, one would need some data. This is to be used for two main purposes
- Firstly before I give this code access to my share account, I will see what would have happened if I had been trading on a particular day, using  the prices collect to determine profit or loss. This lets me tweak my automated stratergy per share and produce best results. Also replaces using a demo account, meaning I am not starting blind.
- Next, this seems like the perfect project to learn how to build a neural network or some form of machine learning. I have data and need a simply answer. The data will be collected into a form to be used in model training. 

PHASE 2: The tests
- Now we run the simulations. Just checking how much is gained or lost/ Tweak the varibles near the top. 
- I have uploaded setting I like to use for RDF on JSE. Also, note each prices (Taken from above code) uses 30 second intervals

Phase 3: The Neural NET
- Just two models used, Support Vector and Linear Regression. I had fun with them.
